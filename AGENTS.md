# Agent Instructions

## Upstream-First Fork Maintenance

- Treat current `marlocarlo/master` as the base for all psmux work. Before
  changing fork behavior, fetch that branch and bring the fork forward first.
- Rebuild from the current upstream tip and reapply only the deliberate
  differences recorded in `FORK.md`. Do not merge accumulated fork history over
  a newer upstream or revive an older fork change because it still exists in
  history.
- When upstream provides a maintained difference, use the upstream
  implementation, remove the redundant fork patch, and update `FORK.md` in the
  same change.
- Keep the fork current as part of every fork-specific change; a stale upstream
  base is a blocker, not a supported development state.

## Test Isolation

- Never run psmux tests or commands that may create sessions in the default
  namespace when working from an active psmux session.
- Some Rust tests create sessions internally and bypass the CLI `-L` option.
  Do not run `cargo test --all-targets` locally unless the process is inside a
  disposable Windows account, VM, or CI environment.
- Prefer safe targeted unit tests that do not start psmux servers, together
  with `cargo check`.
- Run runtime and integration checks with a unique namespace:
  `psmux -L <unique-test-namespace> ...`.
- Snapshot the default session list before and after runtime checks. Stop and
  investigate if it changes.
- Clean up only the test namespace with
  `psmux -L <unique-test-namespace> kill-server`.
- Never use bare `psmux kill-server` for test cleanup because it affects every
  namespace.
- Run the full test suite only in CI or another disposable Windows environment
  where user sessions cannot be affected.
