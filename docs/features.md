## Terminal Multiplexing

- Split panes horizontally (`Prefix + %`) and vertically (`Prefix + "`)
- Multiple windows with clickable status-bar tabs
- Session management: detach (`Prefix + d`) and reattach from anywhere
- 5 layouts: even-horizontal, even-vertical, main-horizontal, main-vertical, tiled
- **Floating panes** : `new-pane` (`newp`) creates a pane that floats above the tiled layout, positioned with `-X`/`-Y`, sized with `-x`/`-y`, titled with `-T`, bordered with `-B`, and movable and resizable with the mouse. See [scripting.md](scripting.md)
- **Cross-session pane transfer** : `join-pane -s othersession:1.0` and `move-pane` move a live pane between two independent session servers. The real console stays put and its input and output are tunneled, so the running program never notices. See [scripting.md](scripting.md)

## Full Mouse Support

- **Click** any pane to focus it, input goes to the right shell
- **Drag** pane borders to resize splits interactively
- **Click** status-bar tabs to switch windows
- **Scroll wheel** in any pane, scrolls that pane's output (configurable via `scroll-enter-copy-mode`)
- **Drag-select** text to copy to clipboard
- **Drag auto-scroll** : dragging a selection past the top of a pane continues it into scrollback via copy mode, and holding the pointer on the pane's first or last row keeps scrolling one line every 50ms, like tmux; psmux additionally keeps scrolling, faster, when the pointer moves past the edge. Output taller than the window can be selected in one gesture. With `scroll-enter-copy-mode off`, a selection made over a direct-scrolled view also continues past the bottom edge, back toward the live output
- **Right-click** to paste or copy selection
- **tmux-like release copy selection** : pane-clipped drag copy on left-button release with word/line multi-click (`pwsh-mouse-selection on`)
- **Disable client-side selection** : let in-pane TUI apps (opencode, lazygit, etc.) handle their own mouse selection (`mouse-selection off`)
- **VT mouse forwarding** : apps like vim, htop, and midnight commander get full mouse events
- **3-layer mouse injection** : VT protocol, VT bridge (for WSL/SSH), and native Win32 MOUSE_EVENT
- **Mouse over SSH** : works from any OS client when server runs Windows 11 build 22523+
- **Disable mouse** : `set -g mouse off` fully suppresses mouse event handling

## tmux Theme & Style Support

- **20+ customizable style options** : status bar, pane borders, messages, copy-mode highlights, popups, menus, window backgrounds. See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for the full table
- **Full color spectrum** : 16 named colors, 256 indexed (`colour0` to `colour255`), 24-bit true color (`#RRGGBB`)
- **Text attributes** : bold, dim, italic, underline, blink, reverse, strikethrough, and more
- **Styled underscores** : double, curly (undercurl), dotted and dashed underlines from `ESC[4:2m` through `ESC[4:5m`, plus the SGR 58 underline colour, are parsed and passed on to the outer terminal
- **Status bar** : fully customizable left/right content with format variables
- **Window tab styling** : separate styles for active, inactive, activity, bell, and last-used tabs
- **Pane border line styles** : `set -g pane-border-lines double` picks the glyph set (`single`, `double`, `heavy`, `simple`, `number`, `spaces`, `none`), and a post-pass upgrades straight runs to proper junction glyphs where borders meet. See [configuration.md](configuration.md)
- Compatible with existing tmux theme configs

## Copy Mode (Vim Keybindings)

- **53 vi-style key bindings** : motions, selections, search, text objects
- Visual, line, and **rectangle selection** modes (`v`, `V`, `Ctrl+v`)
- `/` and `?` search with `n`/`N` navigation
- `f`/`F`/`t`/`T` character find, `%` bracket matching, `{`/`}` paragraph jump
- Named registers (`"a` through `"z`), count prefixes, word/WORD variants
- Mouse drag-select copies to Windows clipboard on release and returns to the live view (tmux parity); dragging at the pane's first/last row auto-scrolls through scrollback
- **Line numbers** : `set -g copy-mode-line-numbers relative` adds a left gutter, with `off`, `default`, `absolute`, `relative`, and `hybrid` modes and independent styling through `copy-mode-line-number-style` and `copy-mode-current-line-number-style`. See [configuration.md](configuration.md)

See [keybindings.md](keybindings.md) for the full copy mode key reference.

## Format Engine

- **140+ tmux-compatible format variables** across sessions, windows, panes, cursor, client, and server
- Conditionals (`#{?cond,true,false}`), comparisons (`#{==:a,b}`, `#{!=:a,b}`), boolean logic (`#{||:}`, `#{&&:}`)
- Regex substitution (`#{s/pat/rep/:var}`), string manipulation
- Loop iteration (`#{W:fmt}`, `#{P:fmt}`, `#{S:fmt}`) over windows, panes, sessions
- Truncation, padding, basename, dirname, strftime, shell quoting
- Inline style directives: `#[list]`, `#[fill]`, `#[align=left|centre|right]`, `#[range=...]`

## Scripting & Automation

- **90+ tmux-compatible commands** : everything you need for automation. Run `psmux list-commands` for the live list
- `send-keys`, `capture-pane`, `pipe-pane` for CI/CD and DevOps workflows
- `display-popup` for floating popup windows with custom commands
- `display-menu` for interactive context menus
- `choose-tree` for interactive session/window/pane selection
- `choose-buffer` and `choose-client` for interactive buffer and client picking
- `if-shell` and `run-shell` for conditional config logic
- **30 event hooks** : `after-new-window`, `after-split-window`, `client-attached`, `pane-died`, `pane-focus-in`, `window-linked`, and more. Note that `set-hook` accepts any name without validating it, so a typo silently never fires
- **Config file conditionals** : `%if`, `%elif`, `%else`, `%endif` blocks (they nest), plus `%hidden NAME=value`. The condition is a format string, so `%if "#{==:#{@theme},dark}"` works. See [configuration.md](configuration.md)
- **User defined command aliases** : `set -g command-alias 'bigsplit=split-window -p 70'` creates your own command name. It resolves from key bindings and config lines. See [configuration.md](configuration.md)
- **Positional pane targets** : `select-pane -t '{top-right}'`, plus `{top-left}`, `{bottom-left}`, `{bottom-right}`, `{top}`, `{bottom}`, `{left}`, `{right}`. See [scripting.md](scripting.md)
- **Prompt history** : `show-prompt-history` (`showphist`) and `clear-prompt-history` (`clearphist`) inspect and reset what the command prompt remembers. See [scripting.md](scripting.md)
- **Session groups** : `set -g session-group <name>` or `psmux server -g <name>` links sessions, surfaced by `#{session_group}`, `#{session_group_size}`, and `#{session_grouped}`. See [scripting.md](scripting.md)
- Paste buffers, named registers, `display-message` with format variables
- Server namespaces via `-L` for running isolated psmux instances
- Command chaining with `;` for multi-step bindings
- `switch-client` for programmatic session switching
- `break-pane` and `join-pane` for pane reorganization
- `wait-for` with lock/signal/unlock for cross-pane synchronization
- `confirm-before` for user confirmation dialogs

See [scripting.md](scripting.md) for full command reference and examples, and
[tmux_args_reference.md](tmux_args_reference.md) for per-command flags.

## Session Persistence

- psmux session servers survive SSH disconnects and terminal crashes
- Detach with `Prefix + d`, reconnect with `psmux attach` from any terminal
- Warm sessions (`set -g warm on`, default) pre-spawn background servers for instant session creation
- Use [psmux-resurrect](https://github.com/psmux/psmux-plugins/tree/main/psmux-resurrect) to save/restore sessions across reboots
- Use [psmux-continuum](https://github.com/psmux/psmux-plugins/tree/main/psmux-continuum) for automatic periodic save/restore

## Session Switching

- **Prefix + s** opens an interactive session/window/pane tree chooser
- **Prefix + (** and **Prefix + )** cycle through sessions
- `psmux pick` attaches from a normal shell and opens the session chooser on its first frame
- `switch-client -t sessionname` switches to a named session
- `switch-client -l` returns to the last (most recently used) session
- Create multiple sessions with `new-session -s name` and switch freely between them

## Display Panes Overlay

- **Prefix + q** shows numbered overlays on all panes for quick selection
- Press a number key to jump to that pane instantly
- Numbers respect `pane-base-index` (e.g., starts from 1 if configured)
- Overlay auto-dismisses after `display-panes-time` milliseconds (default: 1000ms)
- Only single-digit pane numbers (0 through 9) can be selected by keypress

## Nesting Prevention

- psmux automatically detects when running inside an existing session and blocks the launch, so you never end up with a psmux inside a psmux
- This matches tmux behavior, where nesting requires explicitly unsetting `$TMUX`
- To create a new session from inside psmux, use the command prompt (`Prefix + :`) and type `new-session`
- Set `PSMUX_ALLOW_NESTING=1` in the pane's environment when you genuinely want to nest

## Dead Pane Handling

- `set -g remain-on-exit on` keeps panes visible after their process exits
- Dead panes display their final output for inspection
- `respawn-pane` restarts the shell or a new command in a dead pane
- Useful for monitoring long-running processes that may crash

## Command Prompt

- **Prefix + :** opens a command prompt at the bottom of the screen
- Full cursor movement (arrow keys, Home, End) within the command line
- Command history (Up/Down arrows recall previous commands)
- Any psmux/tmux command can be typed and executed interactively
- Supports `source-file`, `set-option`, `split-window`, `list-commands`, and every other psmux command
- Prompt history is persistent and inspectable with `show-prompt-history`

## Claude Code Agent Teams

- First-class support for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) teammate pane spawning
- Automatically sets `TMUX`, `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS`, and teammate mode
- Each agent gets its own visible pane with full terminal output
- No extra configuration needed: start psmux, run `claude`, and ask it to create a team

See [claude-code.md](claude-code.md) for detailed setup and troubleshooting.

## CJK and IME Input

- Full support for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean character input
- IME composition handled with minimal latency (paste-detection heuristic tuned for rapid IME bursts)
- Korean IME input correctly handled without bracketed paste sequence injection
- CJK text pasting works reliably for any length
- UTF-8 multi-byte characters (box-drawing, emoji, CJK) render correctly in ConPTY panes

## Interactive Choosers

- `choose-tree` (`Prefix + w`): browse and select sessions, windows, and panes interactively, with optional [live preview pane](preview.md) (`p` to toggle, `set -g choose-tree-preview on` to default on)
- `choose-session` (`Prefix + s`): browse sessions only, same live preview support
- `pick`: attach from a normal shell and start in `choose-session`; this is the only CLI spelling for that startup path
- `choose-buffer` (`Prefix + =`): pick from paste buffers with preview
- `choose-client`: view connected clients
- `customize-mode`: interactive options editor
- **Digit-jump** (all pickers): type a number and press `Enter` to jump directly to that row (1-based). A `go to N` indicator appears at the bottom; `Backspace` edits the number, `Esc` cancels. Every row is numbered so the mapping is visible at a glance. See [keybindings.md](keybindings.md#picker-navigation-choose-session-choose-tree-choose-buffer-list-keys-customize) for the full key reference.

## Multi-Shell Support

- **PowerShell 7** (default), PowerShell 5, cmd.exe
- **Git Bash**, WSL, nushell, and any Windows executable
- Sets `TERM=xterm-256color`, `COLORTERM=truecolor` automatically
- Sets `TMUX` and `TMUX_PANE` env vars for tmux-aware tool compatibility

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for `default-shell` and other options.

## Named Paste Buffers

- `set-buffer -b <name> "text"` to create a named buffer
- `show-buffer -b <name>` to read it back
- `paste-buffer -b <name>` to paste into the active pane
- `delete-buffer -b <name>` to remove it
- Named buffers are separate from the anonymous buffer stack
- Useful for structured data exchange between automation steps

## Diagnostics

- **Debug logging subsystem** : eleven independent loggers, all off by default, each writing a timestamped and capped log covering one subsystem (client rendering, styles, input, server, session registry, mouse, SSH input, latency, popups, warm pool, auth handshake). Turn one on with a single environment variable, for example `$env:PSMUX_INPUT_DEBUG = "1"`
- **Always on failure records** : `server-startup.log` captures the real reason a server could not start, including the Windows error and the exact path it tried to spawn, `config-warnings.log` captures config lines that were silently ignored, and `crash.log` captures a panic with a full backtrace
- **Predictable state layout** : every runtime file lives under `%USERPROFILE%\.psmux\`, so a bug report can include exactly what is on disk

See [diagnostics.md](diagnostics.md) for every log file, what each records, and what to attach to a bug report.

## Developer Integration and tmux API Compatibility

psmux is designed as a drop-in replacement for tmux on Windows at the API level:

- **Same CLI protocol**: 90+ tmux commands with identical flags, arguments, and output formats. Run `psmux list-commands` for the live list
- **Same stable IDs**: `$N` (session), `@N` (window), `%N` (pane) targeting works identically
- **Same control mode**: `-C`/`-CC` wire protocol with `%begin`/`%end` framing and async notifications
- **Same format engine**: 140+ format variables, conditionals, loops, regex, string ops
- **Same config**: Reads `~/.tmux.conf` directly
- **libtmux compatible**: The libtmux Python library works with psmux (see note on Windows encoding)
- **tmux.exe alias**: psmux installs a `tmux.exe` alias so existing scripts find it on the PATH

For a full developer integration guide with examples in Python, PowerShell, Node.js, Go, and Rust, see [integration.md](integration.md).
