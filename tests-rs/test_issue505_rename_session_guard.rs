// Issue #505: "session rename results in failing new session creation".
//
// A server holds the single-server-per-name mutex (issue #2) for its whole life,
// keyed on the session's port-file base. That base changes on rename, but the
// guard never followed it, so the OLD name stayed locked forever: any later
// server spawned under it exited as a "duplicate" without writing a .port file
// and the caller reported `failed to create session '<old name>'`. Since the
// default session name is "0" (exactly what a bare `new-session` auto-picks),
// renaming the first session broke plain `new-session` outright. The flip side
// is just as bad: the NEW name was left unguarded, so a renamed session lost its
// duplicate-server protection entirely.
//
// These tests drive rekey_session_guard directly. Every ownership probe runs on
// a SPAWNED THREAD on purpose: a Windows mutex is recursive for its owning
// thread, so probing from the thread that holds it would always report "free"
// and could never catch the stale hold.
